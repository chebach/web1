<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.daum.net/" target="_blank" title="nike">Hypertext Markup Language</a> (HTML) is the standard markup 
    <strong>language</strong>for <u>documents</u> designed to be displayed in a web browser.
     It can be assisted by technologies 
     such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
     scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from
     a web server or from local storage and render
      the documents into multimedia web pages. 
      HTML describes the structure of a web
       page semantically and originally included
        cues for the appearance of the document.
        HTML elements are the building blocks 
        of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
        images and other objects such as 
        interactive forms may be embedded into the 
        rendered page. </p>
        <img src="1.jpg" width="50%">
        <p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML provides a means to
         create structured documents by denoting
          structural semantics for text such as headings,
           paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, 
            written using angle brackets. 
            Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly
             introduce content into the page. Other tags
              such as </p> surround and provide information
